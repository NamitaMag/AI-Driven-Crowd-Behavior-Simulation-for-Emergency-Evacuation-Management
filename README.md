# AI-Driven-Crowd-Behavior-Simulation-for-Emergency-Evacuation-Management

This project introduces an intelligent fire‑evacuation framework that uses building blueprints, crowd modeling, and AI planning to guide people to safety. Prompt engineering is applied to incorporate crowd demographics . Deep‑learning‑based segmentation was used to extract walls, corridors, exits, and hazard zones from floor plans, converting them into a spatial graph. Crowd movement is simulated with the Social Force Model to reflect panic, density, and mobility limits.

A Retrieval‑Augmented Generation pipeline creates fire‑specific evacuation policies from trusted safety guidelines. These policies, combined with the spatial graph and crowd simulation, are processed by a Graph Neural Network to predict optimal evacuation routes, considering congestion and accessibility. Simulations achieved a path efficiency of 0.93.
